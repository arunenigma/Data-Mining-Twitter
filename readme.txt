The source code for the project is in python_code folder.

I havenâ€™t included the python libraries I used. Please download and install them before running the code or I can come and execute the code for you in your office.

The results along with plots and graphs are in project_results folder. I have made a separate folder for each of the queries I tried with.

The folder web_code just contains some open source code and libraries required for my project(visualization tools primarily).

Python version: 2.7.2


Thank You !
